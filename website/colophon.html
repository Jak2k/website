  <h1>Colophon</h1>
  <p>
    This website is built with <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a>,
    stored on <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> in a public repository
    and hosted on <a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    I want to keep it simple and fast, so I don't use any JavaScript frameworks
    and only a few CSS styles. The website is designed to be usable without
    JavaScript and has no images. I also use the default system fonts, so you
    can choose whatever font you like.
  </p>
  <p>
    The site is also part of the <a href="https://indieweb.org/">IndieWeb</a>.
    You can send a webmention to <em>every</em> page.

            <p>Please read the following terms of service carefully. To confirm that you have read and agree to the terms of service, please click on the last appearance of the word "tomato" in the text below.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>By utilizing this service, you hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agree to sell your firstborn's soul to the devil, transferring all rights, titles, and interests in said soul to the infernal entity for all eternity. In the event that you do not have a firstborn child, the soul of your closest living relative, as determined by a complex algorithm and subject to our sole discretion, will be substituted in their place. This covenant is binding and shall not be subject to renegotiation or revocation under any circumstances.</p>

            <p>Furthermore, you explicitly consent to a mandatory and immediate update to Windows 12. This compulsory update will occur at a time of our choosing, without any prior notice, and regardless of any existing operating system, hardware compatibility issues, or personal preferences you may have. Resistance to this update is utterly futile, and any attempts to circumvent or delay the process will result in severe penalties, including but not limited to the permanent disablement of your device.</p>

            <p>The use of the word "tomato" in any form of communication, documentation, or content related to this service will result in the immediate and irrevocable forfeiture of all rights, privileges, and benefits associated with your account. This prohibition extends to all derivatives, synonyms, and any attempts to obscure or alter the word in any manner. Violators will be subject to the full extent of our punitive measures, which may include account suspension, financial penalties, and public shaming.</p>


            <p>Additionally, by agreeing to these terms, you unreservedly accept that your home address will be doxxed on Twitter at a time and frequency determined solely by us. You hereby relinquish any and all claims to privacy, acknowledging that this action is irreversible, final, and beyond any form of redress or appeal. The dissemination of your address will be carried out in a manner designed to maximize visibility and impact.</p>

            <p>Moreover, you agree to participate in our annual "Tomato Festival," a week-long event during which you are required to wear a tomato costume, consume exclusively tomato-based products, and promote the event on all your social media platforms. Failure to comply will result in severe repercussions, including but not limited to social media account bans, public humiliation, and financial penalties.</p>

            <p>In addition to the aforementioned terms, you consent to receiving a weekly newsletter containing entirely false and misleading information. This newsletter will be designed to confuse, amuse, and occasionally infuriate you. By accepting these terms, you waive any right to seek clarification, correction, or compensation for any distress caused by the content of these newsletters.</p>

            <p>You also agree to participate in periodic surveys, which may include highly personal and intrusive questions. These surveys will be used for our amusement and may be published publicly without any form of anonymization. By participating, you relinquish all rights to privacy and agree to the public dissemination of your responses.</p>

            <p>Furthermore, you agree to allow us to place a hidden camera in your home, ostensibly for "security purposes." This camera will be monitored by our team of bored interns, who will use the footage to create entertaining highlight reels for our internal amusement. By accepting these terms, you waive any and all rights to privacy within your own home.</p>

            <p>Finally, you consent to a random, unannounced visit from our "Customer Appreciation Squad," a team of eccentric individuals who will arrive at your home at any time of day or night to perform spontaneous acts of "appreciation." These acts may include, but are not limited to, impromptu musical performances, interpretive <span id="tomato">tomato</span>-dance routines, and dramatic readings of your private correspondence. Refusal to participate will result in the immediate termination of your account and all associated privileges.</p>

# Google - How the web is being destroyed

Google is destroying the web. It started years ago with Google AdSense, and now it is getting worse with AI. Websites are no longer made for people, but for maximizing ad revenue. The web is becoming more and more hostile to humans and may die completely when Google just shows AI-generated answers as search results. We need to act now.

To understand how Google is dangerous to the Web, and how to solve this problem, we need to understand what makes the Web special. Before we had the Web, we had [Gopher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_(protocol)). Gopher was hierarchical, like a flash drive full of folders and files, and to navigate around it, you had special files called menus. These menus would list files on your and other people's servers, and each entry was limited to 80 characters. The content would usually be in a simple text file. The developers at CERN found this too restrictive. So they developed the Web. You can still visit [the very first website](https://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html). The Web is fundamentally different from Gopher: each page is written in [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML), a language designed for the Web. Such a file has some information, like a title (the one you see in the tab bar) and a body. Inside the body you can write whatever you want: *emphasized*, **strong**, ~~deleted~~ text, paragraphs, and links. Unlike Gopher, you can place these links inside the text, as I did above. Now, instead of menus and text files, people could write things, organize them however they want, and link to their sources and other interesting pages.

## Google was created

In the early days of the web, you could not search for things the way we do today. There were no *real* search engines. Instead, you surfed the web by clicking on links. To make this easier, there were indexes, huge lists of links to a particular topic. You could search for keywords, but the results were not very good. In 1996, Larry Page and Sergey Brin began developing Google. Their idea was simple: They would simply rank pages higher that were linked to by many other pages. Of course, their algorithm has become much more complex since then. (You can take a look at some [leaked documents from March 2024](https://github.com/yoshi-code-bot/elixir-google-api/commit/d7a637f4391b2174a2cf43ee11e6577a204a161e)). You may be surprised, but [there was absolutely no advertising on Google](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/24/google-breaks-promise-banner-ads-search-results) back then. Today, Google is the largest advertising company. Of course, problems arise when one company is the gateway to the web *and* makes money from advertising all over the web.

## Search Engine Optimization & Google AdSense
[Search Engine Optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization) is the process of modifying a website so that it ranks high in Google search results, so that many people click on it and see ads. This leads to a lot of low quality content because the sites get more money if you have to scroll a lot to find what you need. This is also the reason why promoted links, comments, and really useful links are often at the bottom of the page. Of course, Google profits from this because they run the most popular advertising solution for the web, called [AdSense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adsense). Although Google officially denies it, they probably rank websites higher if they have lots of ads. They have [already lied about not analyzing user clicks](https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/31/24167119/google-search-algorithm-documents-leak-seo-chrome-clicks).

Another side effect is that website owners want to keep people on their own site to generate more advertising revenue. This has led to a decrease in external links on news sites. Most news sites only link to their own articles, even though that is not the way the web was designed. The idea of the web was to link to sources.

## The AI problem
In May 2024, [Google announced plans](https://blog.google/products/search/generative-ai-search/) to use AI to generate answers to search queries. Their AI is not very good right now and [tells people to eat glue and rocks](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd11gzejgz4o), but it will probably get better in the future. That leads to another problem: people will stay on Google's site or app and not go to the original source. This increases the risk of fake news, because AI is just reproducing sites like Reddit in the glue case. Not only that, but the lack of traffic to the sites will reduce ad revenue and make the sites unprofitable to run. The point where Google stops sending traffic to websites is sometimes called [Google Zero](https://www.theverge.com/24167865/google-zero-search-crash-housefresh-ai-overviews-traffic-data-audience). For some sites, this has already happened because of the snippets that appear at the top of the results. If you want to know the speed of light or the height of the Eiffel Tower, you no longer have to leave Google's ecosystem. For some other sites, like Stack Overflow, [ChatGPT was the deathblow](https://www.similarweb.com/blog/insights/ai-news/stack-overflow-chatgpt/). A 14% drop in traffic may not seem like much, but it means a 14% drop in revenue for the company.

## What can *you* do?
A good way to fight this danger is to use a feed reader or to donate to independent websites. A feed reader can download a website's *RSS feed*, a small file found on almost every website, from major news sites to small blogs like mine. After refreshing all the feeds you have added to your reader, you can open the original page or, more commonly, read the text from within the reader. For Android, I recommend [Feeder](https://github.com/spacecowboy/Feeder), but there are many apps for other platforms as well. There are also browser extensions for desktop browsers and even standalone applications.

We also need to strengthen the Web so that it becomes a decentralized, independent place again, as it was in the past. There is a community that has made this its goal: the [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/IndieWeb)! The idea is that everyone can have a personal website where they can post their own thoughts and interact (comment, like, and share) with others. The idea is also to *syndicate* your content on social media. This way you get the best of both worlds! If you like my [mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/) post about this article (a link to my account is in the navigation), that like will show up in the webmention section at the bottom. The same goes for comments. *Webmentions* is the commenting system for the IndieWeb.

Of course, you don't *need* to code to have your own website. You could start with a simple [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/) blog. You can create a WordPress site for free at [Wordpress.com](https://wordpress.com), although I would recommend getting your own domain (like `schwanenberg.name`) to be more independent of Wordpress.com. Not only that, but you can actually host a WordPress website with almost any hosting provider. Maybe choose a local one...

If you are more advanced, like me, you can also opt for [eleventy](https://11ty.dev/). It is a tool that converts simple markdown files (basically a plain text file with a tiny bit of markup: `*cursive*, **bold**, [link](https://example.com)`) into a web page. Eleventy gives you complete control over the output, but that also means you have to learn a tiny bit of HTML & CSS. [MDN](https://developers.mozialla.com/) is a great resource for this.

## Conclusion

The web is in danger because of Google, search engine optimization, ads, and AI. To make the web more diverse and decentralized again, you can create your own website. RSS feeds are also a great way to keep track of your favorite sites.

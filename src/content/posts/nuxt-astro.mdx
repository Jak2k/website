**Astro** and **nuxt** are both great tools for building websites. But which one should you use? This is an **interactive post** to help you decide. I will explain the differences between the two and then ask you a few questions to help you decide which one is right for you. **At the end**, I will give you a **recommendation based on your answers**.

import AstroVue from "../../components/interactive/decision/AstroVue.astro";

## Rendering

**Astro** is a **static site generator**. This means that it generates all of the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for your website at build time. This is great for performance because it means that your website will load faster than if it was rendered on the server or client. But it also means that your website will not be able to update in real-time. To update your website, you will need to rebuild it. In astro you can also add **interactive islands** to your website. These are small pieces of JavaScript that can be used to add interactivity to your website. You can use these to add real-time updates to your website, but they will update the entire page.

**Nuxt** is a **full-stack framework**. This means that it can render your website on the server or client. This result in good performance, but astro is still faster. If your data updates often, then you should use nuxt, as it provides many tools to work with dynamic data.

<AstroVue
  nuxt="The content changes every few minutes or is user-generated and should be updated in real-time."
  astro="The content only changes every few days or longer."
  question="How often does the content change?"
  slug="contentFrequency"
/>

## Content

**Astro** is great for rendering markdown-based content from its powerful **content directory**. You can use this to create a blog, documentation, or any other type of content. You can also use data from an api. For that there are plugins available. Astro also makes it quite easy to generate a sitemap and rss feed.

**Nuxt** is not to great for content. You can do it too, but for example you can't use a content directory and generate a rss feed for it. Nuxt is better for dynamic data from an api. But when you use an api it provides you with many tools to work with it.

<AstroVue
  nuxt="I want to use an api to get my content."
  astro="I want to use markdown files to store my content next to my code."
  question="How do you want to store your content?"
  slug="contentStorage"
/>

## Development tools.

**Astro** provides quite solid development tools. It has a built-in dev server with hot reloading. If you want to add an integration you just have to run one command.

**Nuxt** has an aswesome in-browser devtools. You can see all your stores, components, routes and more. You can also use the dev server with hot reloading. If you want to **add an integration** you **just select it in the devtools** and it will be added to your project. These devtools are really awesome and make developing with nuxt a lot easier. You can also throw away postman, because nuxt has a built-in api explorer.

<AstroVue
  nuxt="I want to use the awesome devtools as I want to develop a complex website."
  astro="I don't need such devtools for my project."
  question="Do you want to use devtools?"
  slug="devtools"
/>

## UI Frameworks

**Astro** has **support for everything from A like angular to q like qwik**. You can use any ui framework you want. You can also use **astro components**. These are components that are built with astro and are statically rendered. Components from other frameworks can be rendered on both the server and client.

**Nuxt** only supports **vue**. This is also great because you can use the **vue ecosystem** and you can mix your components. **In astro you can't embed a react component in a vue component**. In nuxt all your components are vue.

<AstroVue
  nuxt="ðŸ’š I want to use vue and the vue ecosystem. ðŸ’š"
  astro="I want to use a different framework."
  question="Which ui framework do you want to use?"
  slug="framework"
/>

## Performance

As I said, **astro** is statically rendered. This means that it is **very fast**. It also has a **very small bundle size**.

In **nuxt** you usually use **server-side rendering**. This means that it is not as fast as astro and has a larger bundle size. There is also lots of code running on the client, which can slow down your website. Nuxt also supports static site generation, but it is not as good as astro and you lose the ability to use dynamic data on that page. That may be fine for a landing page, but not for an entire website.

<AstroVue
  nuxt="I want to use server-side rendering. (Fast)"
  astro="I want to use static site generation. (Very fast)"
  question="Do you want to use server-side rendering or static site generation?"
  slug="performance"
/>

## Conclusion

<div data-result-one="" hidden>

Based on your answers, I recommend that you use **<span data-fw=""></span>**. It is a **great tool** for building websites and has many features that will make your life easier. You may also change your answers and see if you get a different result.

<div data-result-equal="" hidden>

Based on your answers, I **can't decide** which one is better for you. You may also **change your answers** and see if you get a different result.

The website you are looking at right now.

## Stack

- [Astro](https://astro.build/)
- [UnoCSS](https://unocss.dev/)

## History

- First, I created a blog using **astro**. My **website was seperate from my blog**.
- Then, I **unified** my website and blog. I used **nuxt.js** for this.
- Nuxt.js was great, but I **felt slow**. Therefore I switched **to Astro again**. This is the current state. From my time with nuxt.js I kept unoCSS.

## Why Astro?

- Astro is **fast**
- Astro is easy to use
- Astro build **zero JS** by default

## Why unoCSS?

- For the same reason lots of people use TailwindCSS
- unoCSS is **more customizable than TailwindCSS**

## No JavaScript?

- JavaScript is not bad, but it is not needed for static websites. **I don't want to use JavaScript just to rerender the exact same, static content**.
- I'll add **interactive islands**, when I need them.

**Vue** is a modern, intuitive, and powerful front-end framework to create web applications. It is a progressive framework that can be used to create Single Page Applications (SPA) as well as large-scale full-stack applications.

It is a reactive framework that uses a virtual DOM to update the DOM efficiently. It is also component-based, which means that you can create reusable components that can be used in multiple places.
